"""Sanity test for discover_companies.py — runs against a throwaway COPY of
companies.yaml, never the real file. Verifies: known companies are never
re-suggested, duplicates within one run are collapsed, appending preserves
the existing file's comments/formatting, and the appended block is valid
YAML that round-trips correctly. Run with: python -m app.tests.test_discover_companies
