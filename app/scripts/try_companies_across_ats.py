"""For companies seen in your job data (data/seen_jobs.sqlite3) that
aren't already tracked in companies.yaml, guess an ATS slug from the
company name and try it directly against Greenhouse/Ashby/Workable/Lever/
SmartRecruiters's public APIs — the same manual process already used for
AltaML, LawDepot, MongoDB etc. during the Edmonton/Calgary scan, now
automated.

Why this exists (2026-08-12): discover_companies.py auto-adds companies
whose Adzuna redirect_url resolves to a real Greenhouse/Lever API call —
but diagnose_adzuna_redirects.py found that for real Canada/Alberta
queries, 25/25 sampled redirect_urls stayed on adzuna.* and never reached
an external ATS. That path isn't dead code, but it's not going to be the
main way new companies get discovered either. Guessing slugs from company
names you've already SEEN posting real roles (via any source — Adzuna,
Remotive, or companies.yaml itself) is a more direct way to grow the list.

IMPORTANT — this does NOT touch companies.yaml. A slug that returns a
successful API response with jobs isn't automatically the RIGHT board:
Coveo's "coveodeven" was a real, live dev/test board with exactly 1 fake
job, and Treewalk's first guessed slug 404'd even though a *different*
slug for the same company worked fine. Both were only caught by a human
looking at the result. This script prints a report — company, ats, slug,
job count, a few real sample titles — for you to eyeball. Once you've
picked out the real ones, add them with discover_companies.py (see the
snippet this script prints at the end) or by hand in companies.yaml.

Usage (run from the repo root):
    python -m app.scripts.try_companies_across_ats                # first 30 untracked companies seen
    python -m app.scripts.try_companies_across_ats --limit 100     # more (this is slow: up to 10 requests/company)
    python -m app.scripts.try_companies_across_ats --company "Warner Music Group"   # just one, for debugging
