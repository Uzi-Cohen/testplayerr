"""MVP orchestrator: fetch -> filter -> dedup -> write candidates.csv

Pulls from two kinds of sources:
  - companies.yaml   — one ATS board per known company (precise, no noise)
  - aggregators.yaml — keyword+location search across many employers at
                        once (broader reach, more noise — filters.py earns
                        its keep here)

Deliberately stops BEFORE the AI evaluation step for this first pass, so
you can eyeball the filtering quality on real data before spending any
Claude Haiku calls. Wiring in the AI scoring step (ai_evaluate.py) is the
next increment once this looks right.

Usage (run from the repo root):
    python -m app.main                       # everything: companies + aggregators
    python -m app.main --company affirm      # just one company, for debugging
    python -m app.main --skip-aggregators    # companies.yaml only
    python -m app.main --skip-companies      # aggregators.yaml only

Or `make run` for an interactive prompt instead of remembering flags.
