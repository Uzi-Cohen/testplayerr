"""Auto-discovery: when aggregator_clients.fetch_full_description resolves
an Adzuna redirect to a Greenhouse or Lever company not already tracked in
companies.yaml, main.py queues it here after the run. Getting a company
into companies.yaml means every future run fetches its FULL board directly
(every open role, not just whatever Adzuna happened to surface this time)
for free, without going through the aggregator/JD-fetch dance again.

Trust note: a discovered (ats, slug) pair only ever gets here after a REAL
successful single-job API call in fetch_full_description — strictly more
trustworthy than a slug guessed from a search-result URL. companies.yaml
already has scar tissue on that front (Coveo's "coveodeven" and Treewalk's
display-page-ID slug both burned real API calls on 404s before being
caught by hand) — this sidesteps that failure mode entirely.

Deliberately does NOT rewrite companies.yaml with yaml.safe_dump: that
would silently drop every hand-written comment in the file (the "ats:
one of..." header, the Coveo/Treewalk provenance notes, the "Added from
Edmonton/Calgary scan" section marker). Instead this only ever APPENDS a
new commented block to the end of the file as plain text, leaving
everything already there untouched.
